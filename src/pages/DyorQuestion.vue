But we wanted to include this as your first point of research on your journey to properly evaluating a project because it is important and it will aide you in answering many of the subsequent questions. You have likely been told to read the whitepaper several times on social media or by friends and there is good reason. The whitepaper is meant to contain all the information you need to understand the project. It can give background, a breakdown how how it functions, information on the tokenomics, and anything else the writers decided to include in it. But as important and beneficial as this step can be, I have always gotten the impression that very few people actually do it. I have also gotten the impression that many people who tell you to read the whitepaper do not seem to have done it themselves. Now you might be thinking, a lot of this stuff is beyond my understanding so why even bother? Well first of all, you might be surprised. There are some extremely technical papers out there, but there are also a lot of easy to understand ones as well. Or it may be a situation where pieces of it are confusing but large chunks of it are within your wheelhouse. That's OK friend. Try and read it anyways. Google is your friend and if there is something you do not understand you can always read up on it our create a post on Reddit to learn more. And I promise you that while you may start out having difficulties, the more you do and the more you stick with it, the better you will become. This is how learning works and being lousy at something is usually the first step to being great at something. So bite the bullet, give it a shot, and I think you will be surprised at how much you are actually able to absorb. Good luck.",

I think that the simplest answer is that if you are going to commit a crime, it is infinitely easier to get away with it if nobody knows who you are. The exact same reason that bank robbers choose to wear a mask. If you commit fraud and steal millions from investors, the police will hunt you down and you will face consequences for your actions. At the very least, you will be labeled a charlatan and will not be able to easily do the same thing in the future. If you commit fraud and steal millions of investors while remaining completely anonymous, you will never really face any consequences for your actions and will be able to continue doing it again and again.  / Now, does this mean that any dev team that chooses to remain anonymous is 100% going to commit fraud and steal? Of course not. There are lots of brilliant, hard working, and trustworthy developers out there that might prefer to be anonymous, and that is their right. But the good teams who choose to remain anonymous are normalizing the practice which leaves the door wide open for the bad teams to steal over and over again. We as a community should not be willing to invest in or use any dApp where the dev team has chosen to be anonymous, as this potential for fraud will always be present. We have no way to sort the trustworthy teams from the untrustworthy and are left in a situation where we are essentially just hoping that people do the right thing. If a dev team wants us to trust them enough to use and invest in their products, they must give us a reason to trust them. Revealing themselves is a loud and clear message to the investing community that they will do right by us and if they do not, they will suffer the consequences. The good teams who choose to remain anonymous are normalizing the practice which leaves the door wide open for the bad teams to steal over and over again. ",

It is not unheard of for a team to list fake people on the website to give the appearance they have all revealed their identities when they have not. Becuase of this, you must do a little work verifying that each person listed is real. Ideally there will be links included with each name and photo in the teams section that direct you to each persons LinkedIn account, Github, Medium, or any other socials that are used to corroborate identiy and professional credentials. Many teams will provide these freely because they want to make it easy for you to verify them. If links are not provided, that is frustrating but not necessarilly a red flag. Go through the worksteps that are listed here to try to find various social media accounts to confirm thier identity and credentials. / Even if you do find a Linkedin account or social media account, that doesnt guarantee that the information is legitamite. Any good scammer would have gone through the trouble of creating a fake identity for each person they listed in the website. You will need to use some of your past experience and common sense to review what is available and determine if it is legitamite. You have likely seens hundreds of Linkedin profiles or Twitter/IG accounts and can spot things that look funny. Hardly any contacts. A ton of contacts but barely and activity. There are all kinds of things that can appear unusual and are too many to list here, but you will need to review the information and determine if you think it appears legitamite. And typically finding several sources online that can be compared and cross referenced to each other provides additional assurance that the person is real (e.g. has Linkedin profile with several connections and people who have attested to a certain skill the person has, has a Facebook or IG account with similar pictures that appears legitamite, has a few articles written about them from various third party puclications that you are familiar with). / If you do determine that there are people listed in the website but they appear to be fake people, that is going to be a huge red flag. Honesty and reputation are extremely important and a team that is willing to mislead on this would likely be willing to mislead in other areas as well. It is possible that there are reasaonble explanations or it is a rare instance where a person has no online presence, but anyone should proceed extremely caustiously if they are having trouble verifying the teams identities.

So having a team that has a successful history with blockchain or previous start ups suggests that they will have success with the project you are currently researching. Blockchain is also a very new and fast paced industry, so having a team with experience navigating it makes it more likely that they will be successful. Now does this mean that just because someone was successful in the past it is a guarantee they will always be successful? Of course not. Each project needs to be assessed on its own mertis independent of the last, but having that prior experience to leverage will usually provide an edge and increase the chances of its success. It is also important to research prior experience becuase of anything negative that might turn up. Just like prior positive exerience being a good indicator that the current project will be successful, prior negative experience is just as good an indicator that you might want to avoid. Was someone on the team invovled in some type of fraud or illegal behavior in the past? Have they relseased a prdocut that is getting large amounts of complaints from thier users or investors? This is all information that you can use to assess if the current project they are working on will have a similar outcome. Just remember that the past helps us assess the future, but it doesnt gaurantee anything, positive or negative. ",

In order to sell these tokens, they will need sufficient liquidty from other people who are buying the token. Many projects can have large market caps, but if there is not a large amount of liquidity, any purchase or sale of the token can cause large fluctuations in price. In instances where teams and insiders want to exit thier positions and cash out, this can cause the price to crash on the smaller investors who purchased the tokens at higher prices.  // Having large portions of tokens held by the team and insiders is also undesireable due to the centralized control that it means for the project. Decentralization is an important concept in blockchain and there are many different layers and aspects of decentralization to consider. One of those aspects is having this control over a large amount of supply held by a small number of people. Many project have governance features where 1 token = 1 vote and holders can propose changes, vote on those changes, and essentially control the project going forward.

Benefits that must be fully vested benefits often accrue to employees each year, but they only become the employee's property according to a vesting schedule.Vesting may occur on a gradual schedule, such as 25 percent per year, or on a 'cliff' schedule where 100 percent of benefits vest at a set time, such as four years after the award date. Fully vested may be compared with partially vested.' // To give an example in the crpyrto world, the dev team might have 20% of all tokens reserved for themselves. As already discussed in #8, this can create a large amount of selling pressure if all the tokens were unlocked at once. It also can create concerns that there might be more work that needs to be done but now that the teams tokens are all unlocked, they could just take the money and run. To alleviate these concerns, a team can implement a vesting schedule so that not all of these tokens are available immediately. It can be vested over 4 years and 1/4 of the tokens are unlocked each year. It can be vested over 2 years where all the tokens are available at once at the end of the two years. Or anything that the team decides they want to do. By having a vesting schedule in place that makes sense, it is a clear signal to investors that tokens will not be massively dumped on them and that the team is in it for the long haul.",

            "This is another one of those double edged swords that can go in either direction. The smaller a projects market cap, the more room it has to grow. Getting in early on a project when the market cap is at 1 Million means you have the potential for those massive 1000X gains simply due to the fact that the project starts off so small. Similarly, it would be a bit silly to be getting into Bitcoin at a 1 Trillion dollar market cap and be expecting it to 1000X into a quadrillion dollar market cap and be worth more than there are dollars in existence. So when you are researching new projects, paying attention to the market cap can give you an idea of how much room it has to grow. Now the other side of the coin is that extremely small market caps are going to be much riskier invetments than the larger and more established ones. Going back to our example, the 1 million market cap project has a lot of room to grow, but there is a good chance that your investment can fall to zero and be worth nothing. While Bitcoin isnt going to have its massive gains anymore, the chances of it dropping to zero are much lower (although it is still possible). Different investors will have different goals, but that is the general thought proces when looking at a projects market cap. For the purposes of this assessment, we gave more points to the higher market cap becuase we are more focused on not losing money than we are in gaining money. But when doing your own personal assessments, it would be ok if you care more about the larger gain potential and lean towards a smaller market cap preference.",

The total volume traded for a given cryptocurrency has a direct relationship with how volatile it is. Remember, price represents the balance of opinions between buyers and sellers. // If an equal amount (in terms of volume) is being bought and sold then price will be stable, but stability suggests that people’s opinion about the price are well informed; this is known as market efficiency. // Mature markets with significant volume and good price discovery have less volatility. Cryptocurrency is inherently volatile because it is immature and its adoption path is uncertain. Market participants are an unusual mix of recreatioal investors (hodlers), miners, speculators and institutional investors each with varying opinions and motivations, with those opinions subject to significant outside influences. //  So when looking at trading a given cryptocurrency, the total volume traded will immediately tell you how volatile it is likely to be. The change in volume over time will also give you a sense of interest in the project. // It may seem a bit obvious but in order to trade a particular cryptocurrency it has to be listed on an exchange. Exchanges choose which coins to trade, and being listed on the bigger exchanges can make a huge difference to volume. // If, for example, you have an opinion about an obscure cryptocurrency and want to buy it at a specific price. The absence of volume is going to make that really hard - there won’t  be enough buyers and sellers, so the difference between the available Offers (buyers) and Bids (sellers) - known as the Spread - will be wide. // The wider the spread, the less efficient a market and therefore the more volatile. Websites like Coinmarketcap provide historical volume data.",

            "We talked about valume in the last point. Well where do you think most of the volume is coming from in crypto markets? I'd like to tell you it is from decentralized exchanges, but that is just not the case. Perhaps someday it will be, but for now the tokens and coins listed on centralized exchanges have access to the most liquidity and volume of all the tokens. For this reason, checking if a token is listed on centralized exchanges or not is always worth the effort. If you have found one that is only listed on a decentralized exchange this can be a good thing as the price might get some upward movement if and when it ever gets listed on one. But this is also something that you should take caution of. The shadiest projects out there that are trying to scam you will usually be found exclusively on decentralized exchanges, as they will not meet the more strict criteria to get listed on the centralized ones. So to summarize, being only on a DEX can have some upside if it is a solid project, but you should definetly exercise caution as it can be riskier as well. Tokens that have been listed on the big centralized exchagnes such as Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, etc will have access to more liquidy, be more well vetted, and oftentimes have less risk than a project that only lives on a DEX.",
